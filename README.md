# Texture-Segmentation-using-Gabor-Filters
The texture segmentation algorithm in this project involves the following three steps:

• Decomposition of the input image using a filter bank,

• Feature extraction,

• Clustering.


** 1- Filter Bank

We present the channels with a bank of two-dimensional Gabor filters. A two-dimensional Gabor function
consists of a sinusoidal plane wave of some frequency and orientation, modulated by a two-dimensional
Gaussian [3]. The Gabor filter in the spatial domain is given by
